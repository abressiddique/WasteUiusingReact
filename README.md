# ♻️ Wewantwaste Skip Selector Redesign (Frontend React Challenge)

Dear REMWaste HR and Resh C.,

Thank you very much for this opportunity to demonstrate my front-end development skills through this React coding challenge.

This project is a **complete redesign** of the "Choose Your Skip Size" page from [wewantwaste.co.uk](https://wewantwaste.co.uk), rebuilt with a focus on clean, maintainable React code, responsive design, and improved UI/UX — while preserving the original functionality.
